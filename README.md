# MySQL Practice 📊

This repository contains my hands-on practice work with **MySQL**.  
I created this repo to understand how databases work in real scenarios and to strengthen my SQL fundamentals through continuous practice.

All queries in this repository are written while learning and revising concepts, keeping them simple, clear, and practical.

## 📌 What I Practiced
- Creating databases and tables
- Inserting records into tables
- Selecting and filtering data using `WHERE`
- Sorting data using `ORDER BY`
- Using aggregate functions (`AVG`, `SUM`)
- Grouping data with `GROUP BY`
- Working with real-like student data
