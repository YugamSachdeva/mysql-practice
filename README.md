# MySQL Practice 📊

This repository contains my hands-on practice work with **MySQL (MariaDB via XAMPP)**.

I created this repo to understand how relational databases work in real scenarios and to strengthen my SQL fundamentals through structured and consistent practice.

All queries are written during learning and revision, keeping them clean, organised, and interview-friendly.
